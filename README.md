PrimerPro

The purpose of PrimerPro is to assist the literacy worker in the development of primers for a given language. The application performs these functions (and more): It can suggest a teaching order of the graphemes based upon a word list or text data, using an algorithm which calculates their productivity.  It can give a list of words containing any given grapheme from the word list or text data.  It can track "graphemes taught" ongoingly.   It can give a list of "buildable" (using only graphemes taught) words from the word list or from the text data for use in a primer lesson / story.  It can give a list of usable phrases for a story, taken from the text data.  It can check a primer story for untaught residue.  It can give frequency counts for graphemes within the word list or text data.  It can perform a variety of advanced searches, based upon part of speech or other features.
